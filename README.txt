This is a chatApp inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReykxSS-Eh0 It has 3 different Chat rooms
Javascript, python, and CSS.
A problem occures in the last hour causing a crash to the whole app, but I have all the codes that I was using
 I uploaded it to my website as well under projects.
